So this is the bare skeleton of a 1 on 1 fighting game, in which each character fights automatically, according to its AI. 
Using Java's interface functionality, I've set it up so that ***A programmer needs to offer me a class that inherits from the Character Interface***

Look at the **Character.Java** file to see the character interface. 
Look at Burst.Java and TomatoMan.Java, for examples of *Character Subclasses.*

The subclasses should implement the Character interface, but they can add on top of that, so that you're character might battle according to some unique strategy. The game allows programmers to create their own subclasses, and discover who's strategy prevails. It is runnable, so you might give it a try.
