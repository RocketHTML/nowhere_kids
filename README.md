So this is the bare skeleton of a 1 on 1 fighting game, in which each character fights automatically, according to its AI. 
Using Java's interface functionality, I've set it up so that users need to offer a class file that inherits from my simple Character Interface class file. 

The Character.java file is the character interface file. 
Look at Burst.Java and TomatoMan.Java, for examples of files that correctly subclass the Character.java file.

The subclasses should implement the Character interface, but they can add on top of that, so that your character might battle according to your unique strategy. The game allows programmers to create their own subclasses, and discover who's strategy would prevail in dual. It's runnable, so you might give it a try.
